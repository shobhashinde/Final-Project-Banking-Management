## Overview
The **Banking Management System** is a comprehensive project designed to manage and analyze banking operations using SQL. The project is divided into multiple phases, each focusing on different aspects of database management, from basic data retrieval to advanced SQL features like stored procedures, triggers, and transaction control. The system handles various banking entities such as bank details, branches, customers, accounts, loans, transactions, and investments, ensuring efficient data management and insightful reporting.

## Key Features
- **Data Management**: Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on banking data.
- **Advanced SQL Features**: Use **Views**, **CTEs**, **Stored Procedures**, **Window Functions**, **Triggers**, **TCL**, and **DCL** to enhance functionality and security.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze data using aggregate functions, arithmetic operations, and string manipulations.
- **Automation**: Automate tasks like logging and timestamp updates using **Triggers**.
- **Security**: Control user access to the database using **DCL** commands like `GRANT` and `REVOKE`.
- **Transaction Management**: Ensure data integrity with **TCL** commands like `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK`.

## Project Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Basic SQL operations for data retrieval, filtering, and manipulation.
2. **Phase 2**: Advanced SQL operations including arithmetic calculations, joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions.
3. **Phase 3**: Implementation of advanced SQL features like window functions, CTEs, and stored procedures.
4. **Phase 4**: Use of **Triggers**, **TCL**, and **DCL** for automation, transaction management, and security.

## Conclusion
The Banking Management System project demonstrates the use of SQL to manage and analyze banking data efficiently. From basic data retrieval to advanced SQL features like stored procedures, triggers, and transaction control, the project covers a wide range of operations to ensure comprehensive data management, secure access, and improved performance. This system provides a robust foundation for managing banking operations and making data-driven decisions.
