# Project Phase 3: Advanced SQL Operations for Banking System

## Overview
This phase of the project focuses on advanced SQL operations to manage and analyze data in a banking system. The SQL scripts include arithmetic calculations, joins, subqueries, string functions, aggregate functions, bitwise operations, and more. These operations are applied to various tables such as bank details, branches, customers, accounts, loans, transactions, and investments to provide deeper insights and efficient data management.

## Key Features
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Perform calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on data fields.
- **Joins**: Combine data from multiple tables to provide comprehensive views.
- **Subqueries**: Use nested queries to filter and retrieve specific data sets.
- **String Functions**: Manipulate and format text data using functions like `UPPER`, `LOWER`, `CONCAT`, and `SUBSTRING`.
- **Aggregate Functions**: Summarize data using functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX`.
- **Bitwise Operations**: Check for even or odd values using bitwise AND operations.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze data through various lenses such as total balances, average ratings, and profit/loss calculations.

## Summary of SQL Operations
1. **Arithmetic Calculations**: Perform calculations on data fields to derive new insights, such as total interest earned, net balance changes, and profit/loss.
2. **Joins**: Combine related tables to fetch comprehensive data, such as joining customer details with account details or loan details.
3. **Subqueries**: Use nested queries to filter data based on conditions, such as finding accounts with balances greater than the average.
4. **String Manipulation**: Format and manipulate text data using string functions to make it more readable and useful.
5. **Aggregate Functions**: Summarize data to get totals, averages, counts, and other aggregate values.
6. **Bitwise Operations**: Check for even or odd values in IDs using bitwise AND operations.
7. **Data Analysis**: Analyze data to provide insights such as total deposits, withdrawals, average ratings, and profit/loss per account.

## Conclusion
This phase demonstrates the use of advanced SQL operations to manage and analyze a banking system's data efficiently. The scripts cover a wide range of operations, from basic arithmetic calculations to complex data analysis, ensuring comprehensive data management and insightful reporting. The database is designed to handle various aspects of banking operations, providing a robust foundation for data-driven decision-making.
