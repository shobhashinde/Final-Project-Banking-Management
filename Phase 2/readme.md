# Project Phase 2: SQL Database Management for Banking System

## Overview
This project involves managing a banking system using SQL. The database includes various tables related to bank details, branches, customers, accounts, loans, transactions, and more. The SQL scripts provided perform operations such as creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving data from these tables. The goal is to maintain and manipulate the banking data efficiently.

## Key Features
- **Bank Details Management**: Operations on bank details such as retrieving records, counting bank names, and filtering data based on patterns.
- **Branch Management**: Managing branch information, updating branch status, and adding/removing columns.
- **Customer Management**: Handling customer data, adding age constraints, and updating customer information.
- **Account and Loan Management**: Managing account types, loan details, and performing arithmetic operations on financial data.
- **Transaction Management**: Handling bank transactions, updating transaction status, and performing string operations.
- **Credit Card and Payment Management**: Managing credit card details, payment methods, and payment history.
- **Investment Management**: Handling investments, stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, including updating interest rates and maturity dates.
- **Credit Scores and Loan Payments**: Managing credit scores and loan payments, including retrieving records using aggregate functions.

## Summary of SQL Operations
1. **Data Retrieval**: Various `SELECT` queries are used to retrieve data from tables based on specific conditions, patterns, and aggregations.
2. **Data Manipulation**: `UPDATE` statements are used to modify records, such as updating customer ages, transaction statuses, and interest rates.
3. **Data Deletion**: `DELETE` statements are used to remove records that match specific conditions.
4. **Table Alteration**: `ALTER TABLE` statements are used to add, modify, or drop columns and constraints.
5. **Aggregate Functions**: Functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX` are used to perform calculations on data.
6. **String Operations**: Functions like `UPPER`, `LOWER`, `CONCAT`, and `SUBSTRING` are used to manipulate string data.
7. **Conditional Logic**: `CASE` statements are used to apply conditional logic when updating or retrieving data.
