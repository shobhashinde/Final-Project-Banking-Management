# Project Phase 4: Advanced SQL Features for Banking System

## Overview
This phase of the project focuses on implementing advanced SQL features to enhance the functionality and efficiency of the banking system. The SQL scripts include the use of **Views**, **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**, **Stored Procedures**, **Window Functions**, **Transaction Control Language (TCL)**, **Data Control Language (DCL)**, and **Triggers**. These features are applied to various tables such as bank details, branches, customers, accounts, loans, transactions, and investments to provide better data management, security, and automation.

## Key Features
- **Views**: Simplify complex queries by creating virtual tables that represent subsets of data.
- **CTEs**: Use temporary result sets to simplify complex queries and improve readability.
- **Stored Procedures**: Encapsulate SQL logic into reusable procedures for better code organization and efficiency.
- **Window Functions**: Perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row.
- **TCL**: Manage transactions to ensure data integrity with `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK`.
- **DCL**: Control access to the database using `GRANT` and `REVOKE`.
- **Triggers**: Automate actions (e.g., logging, timestamp updates) when specific events occur in the database.

## Summary of SQL Operations
1. **Views**: Create virtual tables to simplify data retrieval and provide a clear view of specific data subsets.
2. **CTEs**: Use temporary result sets to perform complex calculations and filtering in a more readable way.
3. **Stored Procedures**: Encapsulate SQL logic into reusable procedures for tasks like inserting, updating, or retrieving data.
4. **Window Functions**: Perform advanced calculations like running totals, rankings, and cumulative sums over a set of rows.
5. **TCL**: Ensure data integrity by managing transactions with `START TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`.
6. **DCL**: Control user permissions with `GRANT` and `REVOKE` to ensure secure access to the database.
7. **Triggers**: Automate actions such as logging changes or updating timestamps when data is inserted or updated.

## Conclusion
This phase demonstrates the use of advanced SQL features to enhance the functionality, security, and automation of the banking system. The scripts cover a wide range of operations, from creating views and stored procedures to managing transactions and automating tasks with triggers. These features ensure efficient data management, secure access, and improved performance, providing a robust foundation for the banking system.
